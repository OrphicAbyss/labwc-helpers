# labwc Helper Scripts

This project contains some helper scripts which help with some minor things that need a
script to help make them work in my labwc setup currently.

## Waybar Workspace Plugin

This is to show a visual cue of what workspace you are on and how many there are. Other
scripts don't do this nicely. This one uses the wayland cosmic workspace extension that
labwc currently implements to get data about the workspaces. Waybar supports the newer
workspaces extension instead.
